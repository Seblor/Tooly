      <p>Tooly is a simple toolbox made with VueJS.</p>

      <p>I am a huge script hoarder, when I need to do a task multiple times I tend to automate it, so I create a tool, that will then get lost in my hard drive. This project's purpose is to gather them, and make them publicly available if I think it could be useful for many people.</p>
