# Tooly

Tooly is a simple toolbox made with VueJS.

I am a huge script hoarder, when I need to do a task multiple times I tend to automate it, so I create a tool, that will then get lost in my hard drive. This project's purpose is to gather them, and make them publicly available if I think it could be useful for many people.

# Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

# Tools

Currently there are only 2 tools :

- A network tool that can ping HTTP servers using two request methods. The method, and the minimum ping interval can be configured.
- A steganography tool that helps visually camparing two images. The images can be included as files or base 64 strings. They can also be resized.
